“There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, andthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour andresolution. It is Frank Churchill’s duty to pay this attention to hisfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if hewished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say atonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill—‘Every sacrifice of merepleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; butI must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by myfailing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. Ishall, therefore, set off to-morrow.’—If he would say so to her atonce, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be noopposition made to his going.”“Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration—made, ofcourse, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner—would dohim more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with thepeople he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedientscan ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel thatthey could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by hisfather, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, aswell as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to hisfather; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in theirhearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act inthis sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, theirlittle minds would bend to his.”All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of MissFairfax’s handwriting.I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object thattook me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it isa sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would havesustained me.The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straightlines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made agraceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of goodbreeding that it was not reassuringHe had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had neverheard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice;he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it wasconfronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug forhim. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassinationat the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become themere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by somuch as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with hishungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglersby the way, Bagratión came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrünna few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrünn fromVienna. Kutúzov with his transport had still to march for some daysbefore he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagratión with his four thousandhungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy armythat came upon him at Hollabrünn, which was clearly impossible. Buta freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trickthat had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French withouta fight led Murat to try to deceive Kutúzov in a similar way. MeetingBagratión’s weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to beKutúzov’s whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaitedthe arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna,and with this object offered a three days’ truce on condition thatboth armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declaredthat negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that hetherefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. CountNostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believedMurat’s emissary and retired, leaving Bagratión’s divisionexposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peacenegotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days’ truce.Bagratión replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refusea truce and sent his adjutant to Kutúzov to report the offer he hadreceived.Prince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our frontline and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks,but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed thatmorning, the lines were so near together that the men could see oneanother’s faces and speak to one another. Besides the soldiers whoformed the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookerswho, jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly withhis muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his fullheight without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavytread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried closeto his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a realweapon) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the menwithout losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was asif all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commanderin the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well hewas happy. “Left... left... left...” he seemed to repeat to himselfat each alternate step; and in time to this, with stern but variedfaces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marchedin step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to berepeating to himself at each alternate step, “Left... left...left...” A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out ofstep; a soldier who had fallen behind, his face showing alarm at hisdefection, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with his company. A cannonball, cleaving the air, flew over the heads of Bagratión and his suite,and fell into the column to the measure of “Left... left!” “Closeup!” came the company commander’s voice in jaunty tones. Thesoldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball hadfallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer whohad stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, fallinginto step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominoussilence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, oneseemed to hear left... left... leftSo that was the story of Dorian Gray’s parentage. Crudely as it hadbeen told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of astrange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everythingfor a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by ahideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a childborn in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left tosolitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was aninteresting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as itwere. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was somethingtragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower mightblow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, aswith startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had satopposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richerrose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to him was like playingupon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of thebow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise ofinfluence. No other activity was like it. To project one’s soul intosome gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one’sown intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music ofpassion and youth; to convey one’s temperament into another as thoughit were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy inthat—perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limitedand vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, andgrossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad,whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil’s studio, or could befashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and thewhite purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept forus. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be madea Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined tofade! ... And Basil? From a psychological point of view, howinteresting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking atlife, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one whowas unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dimwoodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself,Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her therehad been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderfulthings revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as itwere, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though theywere themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whoseshadow they made real: how strange it all was! He remembered somethinglike it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who hadfirst analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in thecoloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it wasstrange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, withoutknowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderfulportrait. He would seek to dominate him—had already, indeed, half doneso. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was somethingfascinating in this son of love and death.“I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,” said Lord Henry, elevating hisdark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amusedsmile. “So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of oldbrocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadayspeople know the price of everything and the value of nothing.”“Very well,” said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup onthe tray. “It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had betterlose no time. Good-bye, Harry. Good-bye, Dorian. Come and see me soon.Come to-morrow.”
